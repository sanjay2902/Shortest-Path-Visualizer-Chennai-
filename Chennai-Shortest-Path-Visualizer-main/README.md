# Chennai Shortest Path Visualizer

This project implements a graph-based approach to store areas in Chennai and the distances between them. When given a source and destination node, it calculates and visualizes the shortest path using Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Areas in Chennai are represented as nodes and the distances between them as edges.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two nodes.
- **Visualization**: Generates a Matplotlib plot to visually represent the shortest path on the graph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
